# About Me

I’m James Robert (“[jiaaro][googjiaaro]” on the internet). I live in Austin and I care about stuff.

Here are some things I've worked on and places you can find me on the web:

 - [Github][github]
 - [Biz vs Dev podcast][bizvsdev]
 - [Daily Bread][dailybread], a machine-learningy grocery list app that predicts what you'll add. It supports Apple Watch. The [source is on github][dailybreadgithub].
 - [Media Predict][mp]: A market research company. I joined pretty early on and I was the CTO for a while.

The best ways to contact me are [email][email] and [twitter][twitter]. 

***But***, if you disagree with something I’ve written, you should write a response on *your* blog ☺︎

I try to be friendly and helpful:
