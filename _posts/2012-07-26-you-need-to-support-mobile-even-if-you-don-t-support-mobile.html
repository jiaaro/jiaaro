<p>Your application emails people when important things happen, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't it should. People like to know about important things (and it's the <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/05/31/can-i-get-your-email/">best marketing you could ask for</a>).</p>
<p>Most people check email on their phones &ndash; among other places &ndash; and the <em>best email is actionable</em>.</p>
<p>&hellip;so they log in to take care of whatever you emailed about.</p>
<p>On their phone.</p>
<p>You probably have more mobile traffic than you think. And if you don't, you probably don't use email very effectively.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: You need to support mobile, even if you don't.</strong></p>
