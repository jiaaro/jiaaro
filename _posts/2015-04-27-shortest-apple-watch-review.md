If you’re into two or more of these (or *really* into one), you should check out the Apple Watch:

1. Personal fitness
2. Watches
3. Apple products

That’s it. Review complete.

It’s an interesting product - I still need time to form a more nuanced opinion.

One thing I will say though: the Sport is nice. It’s as nice and well built as the iPhone 6. 

Don’t feel like you need to buy the Steel version unless the *look and feel* of the steel itself is what you’re interested in. Especially if fitness tracking is an attractor for you; the Ion-X glass on the Sport is **more** resilient to impact than the Sapphire screen of the Steel and Gold versions (the glass scratches more easily, but who cares about scratches if you shatter the sapphire screen playing sports).
