title: "Why we got 140 Characters instead of Flying Cars"

If you're an entrepreneur hoping to solve the world’s communication problems, I have a bit of advice: give people communication skills, not another way to send their insensitive, half-baked, thoughts to each other. We've got plenty of ways to transport text around the internet, but communication skills haven't improved all that much since the internet was created.

The problem, of course, is that it’s not particularly easy to monetize other people’s communication skills aside from hiring them to solve some pressing communication problem for you. But we can’ *all* work in PR.

It's easy to see how we got 140 characters. Advertising. But where are our flying cars? You can scarely spend 10 minutes reading or talking about startups and technology without a reference to the quip about [how we *still* don't have flying cars][thiel].
