title: "Why we got 140 Characters instead of Flying Cars"

If you're an entrepreneur hoping to solve the world’s communication problems, I have a bit of advice: give people communication skills, not another way to send their insensitive, half-baked, thoughts to each other. We've got plenty of ways to transport text around the internet, but communication skills haven't improved all that much since the internet was created.

The problem, of course, is that it’s not particularly easy to monetize other people’s communication skills aside from hiring them to solve some pressing communication problem for you. But we can’ *all* work in PR.

It's easy to see how we got 140 characters. Advertising. But where are our flying cars? You can scarely spend 10 minutes reading or talking about startups and technology without a reference to the quip about [how we *still* don't have flying cars][thiel].

I appreciate the sentiment, but the problem we really need to solve in order to get flying cars is an economic one. Flight uses a lot of energy. Energy costs money. The real obstacle is the cost of flying cars; clearly we've figured out travel by air, it just costs too much.

I have a hard time imagining the founders of twitter thinking to themselves, “Let me go work in BP’s research division so we can eventually have flying cars." But that’s the reality of it. That or find a way to break the rules of physics – though if you can find a way to defy gravity I think you’ve got more than a few million dollars to look forward to.

“Let’s focus on the hard problems.” Yes, let’s! But let’s also be honest with ourselves: the hard problems we need to solve are in energy, agriculture, and biology. And hey! What do you know‽ We, as a global society, are spending a *lot* of resources in those areas. The problems are just *really* hard.
