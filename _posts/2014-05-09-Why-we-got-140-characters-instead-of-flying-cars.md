title: "Why we got 140 Characters instead of Flying Cars"

If you’re an entrepreneur hoping to solve the world’s communication problems, I have a bit of advice: give people communication skills, not another way to send their insensitive, half-baked, thoughts to each other. We've got plenty of ways to transport text around the internet, but communication skills haven't improved all that much since the internet was created.

The problem, of course, is that it’s not particularly easy to monetize other people’s communication skills (who will fund you?), aside from hiring them to solve some pressing communication problem for you. But we can’t *all* work in PR.

It's easy to see how we got 140 characters. Advertising. But where are our flying cars? You can scarely spend 10 minutes reading or talking about startups and technology without a reference to the quip about [how we *still* don't have flying cars][thiel].

> We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters

I appreciate the sentiment, but the problems we really need to solve in order to get flying cars are economic ones. Flight uses a lot of energy. Energy is expensive. The real obstacle is the cost of flying cars; clearly we've figured out travel by air, it just costs too much to be practical for day-to-day use.

I have a hard time imagining the founders of twitter thinking to themselves, “Let me go work in BP’s research division so we can eventually have flying cars." But that’s the reality of it. That or find a way to break the laws of physics, but the prospects aren’t looking good for that – there’s at least a Nobel Prize waiting for you if you succeed on that front though.

“*Let’s focus on the hard problems*.” Yes, let’s! But let’s also be honest with ourselves: the hard problems we need to solve are in energy, agriculture, and biology. And hey! What do you know‽ We, as a global society, are spending a *lot* of resources in those areas. The problems are just *really* hard.

I don’t mean to say everything is fine and there is nothing we could do better (as a species, I disdain nationalism), but I really do think the problem is overstated. It’s great that [SpaceX is trying to get us on Mars][spacex-mars], but again, a huge factor in why there isn't much investment in that area is cost. Before any substantial number of people are going to go off and colonize mars, we need to reduce the cost substantially so that it will be economically feasible to do so.

Musk understands this well:

> Elon states that he wants to make a trip to the Red Planet affordable for an average American Family. Affordable, he later said,  is “no more than half a million dollars”.  Considering that this would be a trip to another planet, I personally don’t think 500,000 dollars USD is a bad price.

Because as long as it costs millions (billions?) of dollars, which could alternatively be spent **saving lives here on earth**, a mission to colonize Mars is going to be unpalatable. Same for those fancy flying machines you’re yearning for.
