Using linux to power your robot doesn't have to be big, difficult, and expensive...<p />What you're looking at is a tiny computer (the little box the mouse is plugged into), that uses ~8 watts, running off a beach-towel-sized solar panel.<p />[[posterous-content:ysgptfAGuqoyHBIpDdAy]]No more large-base linux robots! You could probably run this thing on D-cell batteries, and without the GUI, I bet they'll last quite a while too.<p />Oh yea, and they're only about $250 (or $120, I'm not sure if the two are exactly the same)<p />Check out the <a href="http://www.linuxscrew.com/2007/12/03/solar-tiny-pc-linux-sweeeet/">full Linux Screw article</a>.<p />PS - I will put up a follow-up post with a collection of open-source tools for linux based robots.<p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit</span>: <a href="http://www.norhtec.com/products/mcjr/index.html">Here's the $120, virtually identical pc</a> it costs a little more for wifi/ethernet though.
