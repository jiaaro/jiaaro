<p>I think it would be a neat project to make an html5 internet radio (like <a href="http://mixest.com">mixest.com</a> which I love) that automatically time syncs all the clients.</p>
<p>That way you could have everyone in an office go to a certain url and all the computer's speakers combined become the house sound system.</p>
<p>Not especially useful, but it would make a fun little<a href="http://nodejs.org/"> node.js</a> project.</p>
