<p>David M Beazley, a very talented pythonista is gathering data for his talk at pycon. He's doing a little research on the GIL and has asked the community for some help.<p />You can see some interesting initial data <a href="http://ec2-174-129-96-143.compute-1.amazonaws.com/index.html">on his test web page</a> (the one whose server he is asking the community to slam).</p>
<div>If you'd like to contribute, just copy/paste this code into a python interpreter :)</div>
<p>[code]

import urllib2
from time import time
&nbsp;
def slamit(url, seconds):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start = time()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; count = 0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while time() &lt; start+seconds:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urllib2.urlopen(url)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; count += 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print count

# 6 hours
slamit('http://ec2-174-129-96-143.compute-1.amazonaws.com/index.html', 60*60*6)

[/code]</p>
<p>Forgive my lazy exception handling. On occasion you'll get various networking errors as a result of the massive load his server is under like timeouts, or reset-by-peer type stuff. This isn't exactly mission critical code :)<p />Can't wait to hear his talk (I'm hoping to get it online since I won't be able to make it to pycon)</p>
