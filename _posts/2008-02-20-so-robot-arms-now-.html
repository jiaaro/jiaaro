Doing it up: <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/video?id=221">Skywalker style</a>: Dean Kamen (Inventor of the Segway) has made HUGE leaps toward fully operational and very usable prosthetic arms for amputees (see: <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/video?id=221">video</a>). Dean has been quite popular in tech news lately gracing the main pages of the likes of <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/robots/dean-kamen-cyborg-arm-243278.php">Gizmodo</a>, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/03/09/ted-dean-kamens-cybo.html">Boing Boing</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/20/dean-kamens-robotic-prosthetic-arm-gets-detailed-on-video/">Engadget</a> (via boing boing), and Making an appearance at <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers/view/id/10">TED</a> to show off his newest invention.<p />Kind of makes me wonder how he has time to actually do anything, eh?<p />Anyway, a short trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen">wikipedia</a> reveals this guy has done more than build a cute little scooter, and help the army with it's amputee problems. This guy has done a TON of stuff. The man holds at least <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/inventors/Dean_L__Kamen-701867.html/">83 patents</a> issued between 1996 and present for things ranging from insulin pumps, to little parts/systems he invented for his <a href="http://blogs.business2.com/greenwombat/2007/08/a-visit-to-dean.html">water purifying engine</a>.<p />All in all this guy is pretty amazing... I have to admit. Perhaps a role model? if only he embraced open source...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1087162989855557355-2119239554484220320?l=roborobert.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
