<li>Delay calculator</li>
<li>File Converter</li>
<li>Midi-file to notation converter</li>
</ul>let me know (or if you just like one of these ideas, say that)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-7754998492441864821?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
