Hello all, check out the new look! Let me know if you like it, if there are any problems, etc.<p />I'll be writing a post in the morning about the Pros and Cons of using a metronome to while tracking.<p />In other news, my friend Matt will be writing a few articles on reason for this blog. Hopefully those will be up soon. On the topic of guest authors, If anyone is familiar with ableton live let me know.<p />Also, I'm considering doing a comic every Friday on this blog, what do you think?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-7585072040728083697?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
