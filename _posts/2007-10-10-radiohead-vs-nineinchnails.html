Who would win in a fight? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead">Radiohead</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_inch_nails">Nineinchnails</a>?<p />I encourage you to be funny with your answers. but here's my NONFUNNY answer.<p />Radiohead, because they're giving away <a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/">free downloads of their new album</a>.<p />However, now that NIN has been booted from their record label for <a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C21741980-5006024%2C00.html">encouraging fans to download pirated copies of their albums</a>... it's not like you're going to get in trouble for that either.<p />Horray for the <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article2162919.ece">end of music as big business</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-6061650931792994901?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
