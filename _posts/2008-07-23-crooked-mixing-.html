Today is game day!<p /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/03762546896858046481">Harris</a> left a <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/07/nerd.html?showComment=1216765800000#c8977991480543797293">comment</a> on my <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/07/nerd.html">last post</a> asking if I could post the project files to my song <a href="http://fileserver.mixtake.com/downloads/Crooked.mp3">Crooked</a>, so could practice his de-noise powers on it. I thought to myself, What a wonderful idea! So today is game day.<p />The name of the game is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Crooked Mixing</span>, because you'll have to apply some pretty crooked mixing techniques to tame that noise!<p /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 130%;">Rules of Crooked Mixing:</span><br /><ol>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You have to use the noisy track.</span><p />The noisy guitar mic (the Nady CM88) must be within 6dB of the volume of the other guitar mic. The easy solution - the solution you should use in a real life production situation - is to just mute the CM88 and use a digital reverb instead. That's just no fun.<p />
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You have to tell us how you did it.</span><p />You must provide the strategy, and a short description of the general path you took to get to the finished copy.<p />
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You have to use the raw tracks.</span><p />I included my processed tracks as well as the raw tracks. No cheating people.<br />
</li>
</ol><br />That's all folks! Here are the raw tracks...<p /><blockquote>All files, Processed and raw: <a href="http://fileserver.mixtake.com/crooked_blog_post/Crooked_Audio_Files.rar">rar</a> , <a href="http://fileserver.mixtake.com/crooked_blog_post/Crooked_Audio_Files.zip">zip</a><br />Just the Raw Files: <a href="http://fileserver.mixtake.com/crooked_blog_post/Crooked_RAW_Files.zip">zip</a><p />You can also just look at <a href="http://fileserver.mixtake.com/crooked_blog_post/audio">the individual files</a>
</blockquote><p />Here's how I did the vocal processing:<br />[[posterous-content:nrwAIIDBClktoclqDyDw]]<p />The guitar processing was just EQ and a little <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/03/mono-to-stereo-quest-of-champions.html">haas effect</a>.<p />Good luck everyone!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-2325713744122934633?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
