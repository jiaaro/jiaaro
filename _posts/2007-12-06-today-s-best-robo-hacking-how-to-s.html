Today has been a superb day for hacking, so I'll get right to it:<p /><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/SR4BRM5F9AZJRRQ/" style="font-weight: bold;">1. How to make a remote controlled camera from a cellphone</a><br /><embed pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" src="http://www.metacafe.com/fplayer/953187/remote_activated_phone_camera.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="345" width="400"></embed><br />This guy managed to get his camera phone to start taking a video when it recieved a text message, and then text the video back as a reply... pretty nifty eh? Plus there's a full set of instructions, with photos all along the way. Instructables is a beautiful website. One step closer to international techno-spy! <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/SR4BRM5F9AZJRRQ/">Link</a><p /><br /><a href="http://tinkerlog.com/2007/12/04/arduino-xmas-hitcounter/" style="font-weight: bold;">2. How to make a Christmas Hit-counter<br /></a>[[posterous-content:HobfCncjigpfcJyarscy]]Ok this one is pretty awesome... and it's built on one of my favorite platforms, <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> (gotta love open source, even the hardware is affordable). It's nice when you're thinking about the hits you're getting, but the bell does gett annoying after a while... especially when you have a surge of traffic. <a href="http://tinkerlog.com/2007/12/04/arduino-xmas-hitcounter/">Link</a><p /><br /><a href="http://revver.com/watch/443032/botka-the-barely-standing-robot/" style="font-weight: bold;">3. Botka - the "barely standing robot"</a><br />&lt;script src="http://flash.revver.com/player/1.0/player.js?mediaId:443032;width:480;height:392" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Not really a how-to, but it's very cool, and the guy tells you how he built it, and what components he used at the end of the video. <a href="http://revver.com/watch/443032/botka-the-barely-standing-robot/">Link</a><p /><br />PS-I know I <a href="http://roborobert.com/2007/12/linux-robots.html">promised a list of Linux robotics resources</a>, but I decided to do some research and try to make it a little more comprehensive, only to discover the HUGE amount of linux/<acronym title="Open Source Software">OSS</acronym> available for robotics. But I <span style="font-style: italic;">am</span> working on it, so stay tuned for updates.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1087162989855557355-8087033382459733699?l=roborobert.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
