Just in case your faith in my nerdiness was faultering...<p />[[posterous-content:DmqmmvcvzxDuHJbJAJyy]]<p />BANG! There it is!<p />...by the way, that's my newly unwrapped copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A//www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X&amp;tag=roborobert-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>[[posterous-content:gAjxrArBHzkydkjvnlun]]. Fresh from amazon.<p />Also, here's a nice pic of the progress of my drum hack. I've got about an hour of work left. It doesn't look like you'll be able to use the midi functionality while you're playing the drums in-game though. Oh well.<p />[[posterous-content:odDAsfnqCuzfaFwFwvdw]]<p />The world just can't handle how cool I am. I'm expecting a comment from you &gt;:-|<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-622986559621793797?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
