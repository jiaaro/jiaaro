title: How to sell a million records
published: true

You may think that selling a million records is difficult, or requires a bunch of advertising, and promotion. It's much easier than that. Here's what you need to do (in order):<br /><ol>
<li>Be (or become) Black<br />
</li>
<li>Produce a Rap Album</li>
<li>Challenge another rapper (must also be black) to a feud</li>
</ol>Ok... it's not <span style="font-style: italic;">quite</span> surefire, but <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3640219&amp;page=1">it worked for Kanye</a> (and 50 cent). Kanye told reporters that,<p /><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">"They want the black guys to be up against each other, about to shoot each other. And that's not what they got. What they got is two black guys sellin' a lot of records."<br />
</blockquote><p />Clearly the whole thing was set up in advance in order to sell records. This has been an open secret since the beginning of the 'feud', but it still worked.<p />Not a rapper? Don't be discouraged! It worked for <a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2960" rel="nofollow">Brand New and Taking Back Sunday</a> as well.<p />So let's all learn our lesson, and pick a select group of other musicians (or bands) to team up with in order to generate publicity for all of us. Work for the greater good!<p />By the way, for some humorous commentary on Pop culture (including Kanye/50 Cent) check out <a href="http://myspace.com/tvwithoutpictures">TV Without Pictures</a>!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-1571511013001996115?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
