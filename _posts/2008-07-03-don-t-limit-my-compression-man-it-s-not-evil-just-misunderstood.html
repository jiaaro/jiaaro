Even indie rock can benefit from remaining in it's unadulterated form.<p />But in the age of surreal performances, artificial instruments, and the "Radio mix", I don't see a huge problem globing on the compression as just one more layer of distortion.<p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">After all, if the end listeners like it, isn't that what we're <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2007/10/your-name-is-everywhere.html">really going for</a>?</span><p />Even if that's not enough of an argument for you, the Mastering Engineer's <span style="font-style: italic;">job</span> is to make your music sound as loud as possible without making it sound worse. After all it's a <a href="http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_why_louder_sounds/">proven fact that the average person perceives a louder song as sounding better</a>.<p />Of course you can argue that if you <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/06/its-getting-hot-in-here-when-to-record.html">just turn it up</a>, it sounds better without the compression, but I have personal experience that this is not necessarily the case...<p />Heavy, brick-wall limiting (compression on horse steroids), changes the <span style="font-weight: bold;">tone</span> of the music, not just the <span style="font-weight: bold;">dynamics</span>. After a lot of top 40 listening, many people grow familiar with this tone, and begin to expect it. Anything without that "hyper-squashed" tone doesn't sound professional to them.<p />I don't know about you, but I like to make a slick, professional first impression. Don't you?<p /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">edit</span>: I would have left this as a comment but there are already about 30 comments, and I want to make sure people see it. So I learned 3 things today:<br /><ol>
<li>Audiophiles hate compression as much as I thought they did.</li>
<li>Sarcasm is in fact, dead on the internet ;)</li>
<li>You really <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> get a bunch of blog traffic by pissing people off.</li>
</ol>With that said, maybe I should start a feud that divides the internet using population in half... comments? ideas?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-8966911066843051323?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
