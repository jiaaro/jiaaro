Today I'm here to convince you <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> to record drums yourself (at least not until you have a substantial amount of experience). I'll tell you now: I <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span> eventually cover how to record drums using the <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/03/recording-yourself-on-budget.html">b-rig setup</a>, so if you're really set on not paying a studio/recording engineer I guess you can stop reading now. However, I think you should really hear me out on this one.<p />The drum sound - I'm talking tone, reverb, and overall recording quality - can really make or break a recording. It's also one of the only (if not <span style="font-style: italic;">the</span> only) thing you'll hear on a rock recording that really, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">really</span><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>benefits from the use of lots of microphones.<p />That being said, if you're using the b-rig (or similar) setup, I strongly suggest you record your drums at a studio with a pro. Make sure to listen to their past recordings and see that the drum sounds they produce are good first though.<p />Also, Make sure you can either get the project files (so you can just open the project on your setup) or get the engineer to give you the seperate tracks. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do not, under any circumstances, allow the engineer to hand you a stereo mixdown of the tracks</span> (give you one stereo file/cd of all the drum tracks together).<p />Then you lose all the flexibility in mixing the drums yourself (which you want, believe me).<p />Recording your drums at a professional studio really makes a difference in the end. The combination of a good sounding room, expensive high fidelity microphones, and lots of tracks for seperatly miking each drum really improve the quality of drum recordings.<p />Then once the drums are done, and you should usually record them first, you can do everything else at home. You get the biggest benefit of using a pro studio without the outrageous costs. It's a win/win for you!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-443914861536938820?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
