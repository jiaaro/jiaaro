Hello everyone,<p />This good morning I'll keep my update brief since I've been up all night.<p />Whenever you put a microphone on anything, you should try to put your ear in the exact spot the microphone's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragm_%28acoustics%29">diaphragm</a> will be. This is the best taste you'll get of how the track will actually sound, and it'll help you find the <a href="http://emusician.com/mag/emusic_finding_sweet_spot/">elusive sweet spot</a> much quicker. Be careful with amps though...<p />[[posterous-content:AfnecuClglrcumJdlwle]]<p />PS - I was GOING to post an article on how to make your own <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/06/what-heck-is-gobo-its-just-baffling.html">gobos</a>, but my drill broke and I couldn't get the example gobos built fast enough, maybe for tomorrow though ;)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-1484698148517780864?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
