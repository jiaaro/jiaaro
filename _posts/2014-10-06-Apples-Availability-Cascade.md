That thing the keeps happening to Apple, it has a name: "Availability Cascade". Seemingly every. single. iPhone. has a giant media storm about some non-issue making everyone wonder if the latest iPhone is severely flawed.

Turns out this happens all the time. And not just to Apple. Availability cascades are the primary mechanism underlying terrorism, it's why the airlines were in such bad shape after the September 11th attacks. They're the reason people aren't vaccinating their children. And really, the root of most politically charged topics that aren't supported by data.

What *is* notable about Apple's situation is the extent that "availability entrepreneurs" get involved. People care about Apple, so when bad news breaks, it gets a lot of attention. Because people are worried that maybe there really *is* a flaw in the new products. After all, if Fox and NBC are talking about itâ€¦

I'm not the first to point it out, but all that attention translates into ratings, pageviews, and more generally advertising dollars.

The same enthusiasm that gets millions tuning in to WWDC and Product announcements means that a media shitstorm over nothing can turn into a lot of ad revenue. But the initial caring and consequent worry is a prerequisite for all this. That's why there's no coverage of Samsung's flops.
