title: Noise vs. Air Conditioning

Today I was faced with an interesting dilemma; re-record a track, or deal with the noise I inadvertently picked up.<p />[[posterous-content:inucAgjpnBwEAkzynpoC]]<p />I think that if you <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> pickup a little noise during a take, you should consider the take as if the noise isn't there. Is it a great take? just ok? could you do it the same over again? better?<p />If you can do it better, or the same. Throw it out, eliminate the source of noise and just do it again.<p />But what if you can't do it again? You tried for half an hour and never nailed it just so again? I say keep the take with the noise. Of course there are degrees to how abrasive the noise is, so use your best judgment.<p />In the end, the recording I was working on just <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2007/10/your-name-is-everywhere.html">wasn't that important</a> and I was pressed for time, so I kept the noisy takes. I was also going for an indie low-fi sound, and I considered adding some extra noises to the song as well to further the mood. If you're interested, you can <a href="http://fileserver.mixtake.com/downloads/Crooked.mp3">check out the song</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-7112720299811509814?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
