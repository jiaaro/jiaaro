Hello all,<p />I havn't forgotten about this blog, I've just been really busy learning lots of interesting things!<p />Also, doing school work, trying to <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/">build up</a> my <a href="http://mixtake.com/">recording studio</a> (shameless plug), and workin on that hexapod.<p />Speaking of which, here is a short video of it in operation:<p /><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5qOit5BIKH8&amp;hl=en" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5qOit5BIKH8&amp;hl=en" wmode="transparent" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="355" width="425"></embed></param></param></object><p />This bot was built using the following components:<br /><ul>
<li>Arduino Decimilia w/protoshield (from adafruit)</li>
<li>Lynxmotion SSC-32 Servo controller</li>
<li>6 - Hitec HS-645MG Servos</li>
<li>6 - Hitec HS-322HD Servos</li>
<li>6 - sets of pan/tilt servo brackets<br />
</li>
<li>~2 feet of 1/2" PVC Tubing</li>
<li>lots of little miscellaneous screws, washers, nuts, and bolts ammounting to around $5 at your local hardware store</li>
</ul>I'll do a proper writeup and post code when I get some decently complex functionality out of it...<p />Right now I'm just writing functions for things like walking that take speed, direction, and turning radius into consideration.<p />I'm trying to make it nice and simple to use so I can start writing AI without having to relearn my own code (that means comment galore)<p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Next up:</span><br />Adding sensors to give the little lady an idea of her surroundings. Did I mention this particular hex is a gentle fun-loving young female who enjoys walks on the beach and <a href="http://bot-thoughts.blogspot.com/">firefighters</a>? Her name is baby, and I have to say she's definately entered the awkward teenaged years about now (notice stumbling all over the computer equipment and cables in the video).<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1087162989855557355-3840574949665094705?l=roborobert.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
