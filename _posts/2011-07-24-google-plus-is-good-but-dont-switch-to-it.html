title: Google Plus is good, but don't switch to it
published: true

<p>I'm going to assume that since you're reading this, you're a technophile and you're already in the Google+ beta. I'm not going to talk about why Google+ is good, or how google finally "got social right", or why I love it more than life itself or any such nonsense. I'm going to talk about facebook.</p>
<p>Please don't misunderstand the title, I think you should try google+ out. If you like it (I do) then great! keep using it to your hearts content.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>It's still about search</strong></span></p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the primary reason for google+ is the +1 button. All this +1 action is going to give Google's search team a HUGE dataset to mine; no more scraping twitter for "social data". <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=33443992130">Facebook talked about doing this years ago</a>.</p>
<p>It's good to understand Google's motivation before we pass judgement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now about switching: <strong>don't</strong>.</p>
<p>Google is a very powerful company and they've (finally) created a good social network with some profound insights. One that I personally enjoy using more than facebook and twitter. Facebook is also a powerful company, let's not kid ourselves but they are *much* smaller than google.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Competition works</strong></span></p>
<p>If everyone switches away from facebook and uses google+ instead, what we will have is facebook again, except owned by google (remember myspace). That isn't great.</p>
<p>Remember when Firefox started getting traction and over time started getting slow and bloated? And then Google released their own web browser, and all of a sudden Firefox was <a href="http://arewefastyet.com/">getting HUGE speed improvements</a>? Right now we have 4 browsers with significant marketshare (sorry opera) all competing to be fast. <strong>That <em>was</em> great</strong>.</p>
<p>Well right now facebook has lost focus. They're the biggest by a lot and, frankly, they've got a bad case of slow-and-bloated syndrome (and a case of doing evil as well, but the degree to which they are doing it on purpose has been debated).</p>
<p>I'd like to see facebook have a change of heart on their <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebooks_zuckerberg_says_the_age_of_privacy_is_ov.php">crazy policies</a>, and I hope Google+ is the catalyst. But it'd be a day when google controls our search, email, phones, photos, AND social graph.</p>
<p>Let's keep the Social Web <strong>competitive</strong>: let's force them not to be evil (and I don't just mean Google).</p>
