title: "OS X Devs Fail Usability: Tabbing Hotkeys"
published: true
---
<p>This is going to be short; I just want to point out how bad a user <br />experience this is on OSX. <p /> On windows (and linux) there is ONE default hotkey for cycling through tabs in any UI: Ctrl + Tab <p /> So why does OSX have so many? Here are just a few: <p /> Adium: <br />Cmd + left/right arrows <p /> Firefox, Chrome: <br />Cmd + Option + left/right arrows <p /> Safari, Skype, Terminal: <br />Cmd + Shift + left/right arrows <p /> The worst part about this is that it confuses the text editing options...<p /> If I want Cmd + arrow to go to the beginning or end of the current <br />line of text and be able to hold shift to select then the Apple <br />endorsed default (via safari and terminal - e.g. Cmd + Shift + arrows) is already accounted for. <p /> The Current state of things is not good :(</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Things that should be reserved for consistant text editing:</strong></p>
<p>Cmd + Arrow: (go to beginning/end of the current line)</p>
<p>Cmd + Shift + Arrow: (go to beginning/end of current line while selecting)</p>
<p>Opt + Arrow: move one word to the left or right</p>
<p>Opt + Shift + Arrow: move one word to the left or right while selecting</p>
<p>Shift + Arrow: move cursor one char while selecting</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, you can't edit the Safari or terminal hot keys either :(</p>
