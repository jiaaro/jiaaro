I'm sorry I havn't updated in over a week, I've been working nearly non-stop in the <a href="http://www.defensetech.org/archives/001478.html">recording studio</a>. Anyhow... I came across an articled on the coolest thing I've seen in my entire life: a luke <a href="http://www.defensetech.org/archives/001478.html">skywalker-esque prosthetic arm</a>.<p />In other news... I'm working on making a six legged walker bot based on arduino. When I get that done I'll post the full write-up with pictures, and a cute little how-to.<span style="display: block;"><span class="down" title="Link" style="display: block;"></span></span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1087162989855557355-1687380185115521194?l=roborobert.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
