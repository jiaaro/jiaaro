In my post, "Why we got 140 characters instead of flying cars," I made a throwaway comment about how enterprising individuals should focus on communication "Skills" rather than delivery. My cohost Mik, was disappointed that I was writing about economics rather than communication. So today I'll go into the economics of communication skills instead =P

I'll cut to the chase. Teaching communication skills is not a very good idea for a startup. 

This isn't news. I said it in the last post too. Much like learning to code, learning communication skills is valuable. Tremendously valuable, in fact. But capturing that value is difficult. Education startups aren't debuting to multi-billion dollar IPOs. Not Learn-to-code startups. Not Learn-to-write startups. Not learn-a-new-language startups. Not even learn-to-make-friends or learn-to-influence-people startups.

People just don't value education in that way. Universities have managed to jack up the price, but even *they* focus on prestige, job prospects, facilities, and connections.

Conspicuously absent: the stuff you will know when you graduate.

In fact, those parts seem to be losing prominence as a larger trend in education. The focus is on opportunity, not knowledge.

And selling knowledge is getting harder. The Internet is [socializing us][melting asphalt] to believe information should be free.

So… where does that leave you, the social engineer?

*Delivering* communications – no matter how inane the content – at least has a business model: Insert extra communications (ads) into your pipe in exchange for cash.

Personally I hate that business model, but c'est la vie.

Some education startups have innovated in the business model department. [Duolingo][duolingo] teaches you a language, and then their most advanced users translate documents for practice. They sell translation services.

At first blush, you'd expect a high-value skill like computer programming to be something where you can sell education for a high price. If a professional programmer can earn $100k/year for the next 10 years – that's a *million* bucks! – surely you can charge $5k to teach someone that skill. After all, that's only half a percent of the earnings.

But that assumes that you'll only want to learn one career skill - that you'll like the first one you learn and that the skills will remain valuable for a long time. That's not how people work.

If you have never tried computer programming, you really have no idea what it's like to be a programmer (take it from me). Would *you* simultaneously choose a career you know nothing about *AND* hand over $5k to someone whose expertise you are completely unable to evaluate? I wouldn't. Even *without* the risk of some asshole running off with my five grand.
