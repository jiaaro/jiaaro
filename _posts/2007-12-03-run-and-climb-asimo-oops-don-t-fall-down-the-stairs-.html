Honda's asimo is quite amazing, just look at the <a href="http://asimo.honda.com/asimotv/">videos on their site</a><p />He isn't without problems though, asimo was caught on tape falling down the stairs... the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTlV0Y5yAww">comments on youtube</a> are especially funny (which is rare). My favorite is<br /><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Woulda been much funnier if they had shot off a cap gun after putting up the screen</blockquote><p />I have to agree.<p /><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/VTlV0Y5yAww&amp;rel=1" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/VTlV0Y5yAww&amp;rel=1" wmode="transparent" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="355" width="425"></embed></param></param></object><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1087162989855557355-6378576054099637792?l=roborobert.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
