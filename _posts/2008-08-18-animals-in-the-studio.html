Quick post while I'm back in detroit for a few days (back from nashville).<p />I know some people keep pets around their home studios. I wonder if they help the vibe. Do you keep pets around while you record?<p />Do they make noise and mess up takes from time to time?<p />I want answers!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-5394636445874082539?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
