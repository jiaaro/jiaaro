title: All About Batteries...

I was doing some research and I discovered a few interesting facts about batteries... I thought I'd share the basics:<p />The basic unit batteries are composed of is called a cell. Higher voltage batteries, like a standard 9V, are composed of several cells (6 in this case) wired in series to increase the voltage.<p />Each type of battery - alkaline, NiCad, LiIon, etc - has a characteristic voltage for each cell.<p />For instance an alkaline battery, like a AA, is approx 1.55 volts. The only difference between a AA and a D battery is how long the battery will last at a certain amount of load.<p />I did a little test with a bunch of alkaline batteries and found that they pretty much universally put out 5 Amps... regardless of size. If anyone knows... is this an anomaly or is it actually a characteristic of batteries (I couldn't find the info anywhere).<p />But wait... there's good news! If you want to use disposable alkaline batteries - maybe because they're cheap - you're not stuck with 1.5V/5A... you can wire them in series (all in a row) and then add the voltages up, or in parallel (side by side) and add all the currents up. This is pretty common knowledge... so lets move on.<p />You can get some good info on how long standard alkaline batteries will last at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_%28electricity%29">wikipedia</a>. This is measured in milliAmp Hours (mAh). A 500mAh battery (which is pretty small) can power a load of 100mA for 5 hours. A more in depth explanation can be found at the aforementioned wikipedia page.<p />I'll be posting a follow-up to this post in the near future with additional information, as I collect it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1087162989855557355-1699131564867206194?l=roborobert.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
