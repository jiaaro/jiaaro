title: Low End Theory
published: true
---
The use of low end has been crucial to the success of several genres in recent music history, including:<p /><ul>
<li>Rap/Hip-hop</li>
<li>Techno/Dance</li>
<li>New Rock (think 808's and breakdowns)</li>
<li>Electronic</li>
</ul>I'm not going to argue the difference between techno and electronic in this entry, but I'm considering techno to be rhythm and loop oriented and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/daftpunk">created for dancing</a>. Whereas electronic is more of a subdivision of indie rock where the musicians have decided to use a <a href="http://www.myspace.com/metricband">notable amount of synths</a>.<p />Unfortunately, there is a growing trend of low end abomination within certain sects of the music industry. Especially the metal/hardcore and other similar genres (-core or -metal). I recently stumbled on a list of <a href="http://www.edu.lahti.fi/~mkkauppi/">101 rules of black metal</a> on Digg and found the follow depressing example of this mantra:<p /><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">36. To producers of black metal albums: remember...no low end! If it doesn't hurt to listen to, it can't be "true".</blockquote><br />While the list was written as a sort of parody of black metal, the fact of the matter is that this point happens to ring true. I'll also agree that such techniques can be a powerful way of helping the music support the theme of the band and lyrics, but take a listen to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Every Time I Die's "Hot Damn"</span> and tell me they havn't gone too far.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-1628657904968619804?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
