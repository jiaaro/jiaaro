title: Recording yourself on a budget
published: true
---
Today marks the beginning of my series on how to record an entire album yourself... for under $1000. But that's not all... it'll sound good too, as long as you're good, and your instruments are good, and the room you're in happens to sound good. Ok so it's not gonna be easy, but I really will let you in on lots of juicy studio secrets.<p /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 130%;"><span>Here's what you'll need</span>: the B-Rig...</span><br /><ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Microphones</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li>2 x Marshall MXL 990</li>
<li>1 x Shure SM57</li>
<li>1 x Nady cm-88</li>
</ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Microphone Accessories</span></li>
<ul>
<li>4 x Mic stands w/boom</li>
<li>4 x XLR Microphone cables</li>
<li>2 x Mic Preamps (Fast Track Pro has 2 preamps for a total of 4)</li>
</ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Listening Hardware</span></li>
<ul>
<li>1 x M-Audio StudioPro 3 Desktop Audio Monitors</li>
<li>1 x Stereo RCA cable (for the StudioPro 3's)</li>
<li>1 x AKG M 80 Studio Headphones</li>
<li>1 x Headphone extension cable<br />
</li>
</ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Audio Interface</span></li>
<ul>
<li>1 x M-Audio Fast Track Pro</li>
<li>1 x Steinberg Cubase<br />
</li>
</ul>
</ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">TOTAL: <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">$977</span></span> (approx- I rounded each item up to the next dollar)<p />For the next few weeks I'm going to assume you have this set of hardware... I made a <a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/srs7//shop/wishlist/?cust_id=112195541">musician's friend wishlist</a> of this stuff so you can verify the prices.<p />edit: One commenter mentioned using e-bay to get gear cheaper than musicians friend. It's true, you can get lots of this stuff cheaper on eBay. I'll admit it- I love ebay. The reason I don't reccomend ebay as <span style="font-weight: bold;">the</span> place to buy these items is there's no garuntee you'll be able to get them (or that you'll be able to get a given price). However you <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> try to snag better deals on eBay whenever possible. Just don't forget to check the seller ratings, I hate to see you guys get ripped off.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-5514795107753605508?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
