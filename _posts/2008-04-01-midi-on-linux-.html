MIDI on Linux! I love exclamation points! So... a buddy of mine, Jon Dehan created this presentation on using midi in Linux and I thought you might be interested.<p />Unlike Windows XP, Linux can get latencies down to 1 ms (0.01 seconds) which is much less than humans can perceive. And all without specialized hardware/drivers! This is on par with OSX, but linux is free, and so is most (if not all) of the software you'll need to get you midi system running.<p />It's very possible to get your midi synth/sampler running without spending a dime on software <span style="font-weight: bold;">edit:</span> or breaking copyright law *wink*.<p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check out the presentation: </span><a href="http://docs.google.com/Presentation?id=achc3kcfbr2g_72fxgc68c2&amp;invite=csj87rd">Midi in Linux</a>[[posterous-content:swzAabIwJklxCEhnDFlI]]<p />Here are a few of the important links:<br /><a href="http://quicktoots.linuxaudio.org/toots/freewheeling/">Freewheeling</a> | <a href="http://sound.condorow.net/one-page.html#swss">SoftSynths</a> | <a href="http://lau.linuxaudio.org/">LAUG</a><p />ps - don't worry...
