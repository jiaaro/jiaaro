Groceries

Hi, I'm James and I made an app. I think it's pretty good, but we’ll get to the app in a second.

For a long time my wife and I have a shared a grocery list in the built in Reminders app that is pre-installed on the iPhone.

We used it because it was already installed, and it worked. It’s backed up to iCloud, and we could use it from our iPhones, iPads, Macs, and iCloud.com. Pretty Sweet!

I just have two complaints:

 1. I have typed "yogurt" into my grocery list more than twenty times
 2. I can’t tell you how many times I've come back from the grocery store only to realize I forgot to buy bagels
 
What am I supposed to do? lather a piece of wheat bread with cream cheese? I'm not an animal.

Sometimes I would go looking through the "completed" items to see if there was anything I should buy again and uncheck them, re-adding those things to my list. This kind of sucks because I have hundreds (maybe thousands?) of completed items in the grocery list.

Wouldn't it be great if the things I've bought the most times were up at the top? Wait! I'm professional at sorter and aggregator of lists! Maybe I can sort *this* list.

I don't want to use a *new* grocery list app, and start fresh. I want to sort *this* list. That I've been using for years. That I already shared with my wife. 

So that’s what I did.

Daily Bread focuses on the fundamentals. 90% of the groceries I buy are the same every week. So when you add a grocery you are presented with a list of your most common items. 

And you just tap to add them to the list. No Typing! I don't care how good the new keyboards are. No keyboard is better than no keyboard.

And since it syncs with Reminders you can keep using your existing grocery list. You can switch back at any time. And you don't have to convince anyone else to try it (unless you want to).

Oh, and you can use Siri: "Add eggs to my grocery list"

Making a grocery list should be quick and easy, and now it is.
