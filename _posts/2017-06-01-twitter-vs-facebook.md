The difference between Twitter and Facebook isn’t that Twitter is a better company, is better product, or that they treat their users better (they aren’t, it's not, and they don’t). It’s that after reading twitter I feel (you know, ever-so-slightly) happier and more relaxed and after using Facebook I miss old friends, and generally feel anxious and melancholy.

If that’s how it feels to “stay connected”, I’ll pass. Email, text, snapchat, and twitter are still good :)

Also, friends, if you publish anything anywhere (blog, soundcloud, university website, etc). Please, PLEASE, let me know how to subscribe for updates – I am seriously interested in the work you do!

It’s easy just write an email to me (click the link at the top of the website) and say “Hey your blog post says to tell you that I am publishing my work at …”

Please do it!
