title: Delay compensation - what the heck digidesign?
published: true
---
So... Jon over at <a href="http://www.audiogeekzine.com/">Audio Geek Zine</a> has written about delay compensation in protools a few <a href="http://www.audiogeekzine.com/wp-trackback.php?p=513">times</a> <a href="http://www.audiogeekzine.com/wp-trackback.php?p=508">this</a> <a href="http://www.audiogeekzine.com/wp-trackback.php?p=509">month</a>, and if you're unfamiliar with the topic, you'll find them very helpful. But what I want to know is, why doesn't protools have this functionality built in?<p />Accoding to <a href="http://www.soundthinking.com/faq.html#cdrs">Sound Thinking</a>, Digidesign's Protools family is by far the most popular recording software:<br /><blockquote><span style="">With           Digidesign's 85% market share and more than 130,000 users world wide,           it's not hard to see the huge advantage Pro Tools gives you over any           other digital audio work station. </span></blockquote>Well, I find it very troubling that the most popular DAW, and possibly (see: probably) the most popular all-around-music-production software, doesn't have such a basic feature built in.<p />Just about all their competitors have it now:<br /><table>

</table><br />How did this happen? Maybe digidesign has gone unchallenged in the pro-audio market too long?<p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit:</span> One of the commenters has brought the fact that Pro-tools HD  has Delay compensation to my attention.<p />As far as I'm concerned that's about as good as not having it, but that's subject matter for another post.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-6198492743166903662?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
