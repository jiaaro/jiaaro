My posts will be a bit sporadic in the coming weeks... did I mention detroit is beautiful this time of year?<p />So here's the low down: I created a wiki, <a href="http://wiki.deathbyprotools.com/">wiki.DeathByProtools.com</a> as a resource for whoever needs it.<p />[[posterous-content:aFJHwdkwAGcuqFdcupqk]]<p />To get the wiki started, <a href="http://www.rane.com/">Rane</a> Corp has given me permission to merge in the existing information in their reference section, under the condition that they be cited as a reference wherever their info appears. Not bad at all.<p />If you look at Rane's pro-audio reference page, you'll notice there is a copious amount of information there. And by copious I mean <span style="font-weight: bold;">A LOT</span>.<p />So I wrote a quick script to convert all the HTML to <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org/">WikiMedia</a> formatting and got a lot of the work done, but there is still <span style="font-weight: bold;">a lot of editing to be done</span>. All the entries currently appear en masse in an all encompassing glossary page. So first of all, each 'word + definition pair' needs to be copy/pasted into it's own page. Not to mention all the places there are stray symbols due to mistakes in the html to wiki converstion.<p />I'm hoping to make this a resource for music and audio alike, but I need your help! <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anyone may edit the wiki anonymously</span>, but accounts are free and let you keep track of your contributions. Everything runs on the same software as the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikipedia</a>, so if you help out over there, you should feel right at home.<p />If you'd like to contribute, the help will be appreciated very much, but more importantly...<p /><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enjoy the <a href="http://wiki.deathbyprotools.com/">wiki</a>!</span></span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-1794588506305058299?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
