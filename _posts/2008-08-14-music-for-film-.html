title: Music for film?

So... I don't really know much about it but, from what I hear, getting your music used in film a fairly lucrative. The reason I'm sitting here writing about this is that <a href="http://cdbaby.org/">cdbaby</a> has added a way to make your music available to filmmakers. Has anyone had any experience working with filmmakers in this way?<p />[[posterous-content:CnbcFcCEbGJdwxqjqkvC]]<p />If you don't know about cdbaby I highly recommend it, it's a nice easy way to get distribution online (iTunes, Rhapsody, and Amazon to name a few) with no crappy reoccurring fees.<p />I digress, as far as music for film goes. I think that the benefits from the increased exposure <span style="font-weight: bold;">far outweighs the initial monetary benefit</span>. For 3 reasons:<br /><ol>
<li>You have someone else pouring money into promotion of the end product.<br />
</li>
<li>The listeners are much less likely to get distracted and ignore your music.</li>
<li>When someone buys the soundtrack, you get to be bundled in (see: more free exposure)</li>
</ol>Then again... you <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> get paid every time the movie is sold. And money is good too :)<p />PS - does anyone know if there are musicians who specifically write songs on each album with film in mind?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-8120804578788739537?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
