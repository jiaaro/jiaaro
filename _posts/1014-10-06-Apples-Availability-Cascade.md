title: Apple’s Availability Cascade
---

That thing the keeps happening to Apple, it has a name: "Availability Cascade". Seemingly [every][3gsbattery]. [single][antennagate]. [iPhone][bendgate]. has a giant media storm about some non-issue making everyone wonder if the latest iPhone is severely flawed.

From “[Thinking, Fast and Slow][kahneman],” emphasis mine:

> An availability cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may start from media reports of a relatively minor event and lead up to public panic and large-scale government action. On some occasions, a media story about a risk catches the attention of a segment of the public, which becomes aroused and worried. This emotional reaction becomes a story in itself, prompting additional coverage in the media, which in turn produces greater concern and involvement. The cycle is sometimes sped along deliberately by “availability entrepreneurs,” individuals or organizations who work to ensure a continuous flow of worrying news. **The danger is increasingly exaggerated as the media compete for attention-grabbing headlines**. Scientists and others who try to dampen the increasing fear and revulsion attract little attention, most of it hostile: anyone who claims that the danger is overstated is suspected of association with a “heinous cover-up.” The issue becomes politically important because it is on everyone’s mind, and the response of the political system is guided by the intensity of public sentiment. The availability cascade has now reset priorities. Other risks, and other ways that resources could be applied for the public good, all have faded into the background.

Sound familiar? I think the only difference from what Kahneman (the author) is describing is the bit about the political system. Apple’s products aren’t consequential enough to attract government action (though in the ebooks situation is a notable exception).

Turns out this happens all the time, and not just to Apple. Availability cascades are the primary mechanism underlying terrorism, it's why the airlines were in such bad shape after the September 11th attacks. They're the reason people aren't vaccinating their children. And really, the root of most politically charged topics that aren't supported by data.

What *is* notable about Apple's situation is the extent that "availability entrepreneurs" get involved. People care about Apple, so when bad news breaks, it gets a lot of attention. Because people are worried that maybe there really *is* a flaw in the new products. After all, if Fox and NBC are talking about it…

I'm not the first to point it out, but all that attention translates into ratings, pageviews, and more generally advertising dollars.

The same enthusiasm that gets millions tuning in to WWDC and Product announcements means that a media shitstorm over nothing can turn into a lot of ad revenue. But the initial caring and consequent worry is a prerequisite for all this. That's why there's no coverage of Samsung's flops.
