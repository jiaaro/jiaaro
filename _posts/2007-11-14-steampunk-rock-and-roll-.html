I'm not really much of a punk guy, though I do enjoy the occasional thrash. However, I think we all could learn something from the creative masterminds of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk">steampunk</a>. Weburbanist posted a compilation of some of their <a href="http://weburbanist.com/2007/11/11/extreme-urban-retro-10-creative-steampunk-designs-modifications-and-inventions/">most amazing achievements</a> in recent time.<p />[[posterous-content:GpEfutuEEnFhgqguIkpA]]<p />As you may know, I'm a big fan of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern">post modern</a>. That said, we've all got a lot to learn from those before us, but with things moving so quickly over the <a href="http://xkcd.com/181/">interblag</a> and all, it's easy to get caught up in just stealing ideas from the most recent crop of artists.<p />Well I say that's no way to start a movement! Steal ideas people have long since forgotten about and remind them how cool history really is (when you apply modern sensibility to it). Here's to Steampunk Rock.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-3982029609682570700?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
