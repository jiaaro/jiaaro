<p>Been writing a lot of javascript and I thought this was neat:</p>
<p>[code]


class JsObject(dict):
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;super(JsObject, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;self.__dict__ = self&nbsp;


[/code]</p>
