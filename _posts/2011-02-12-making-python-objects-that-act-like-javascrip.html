title: Making Python Objects that act like Javascript Objects
published: true
---
<p>Been writing a lot of javascript and I thought this was neat:</p>

{% highlight python %}
class JsObject(dict):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(JsObject, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.__dict__ = self 
{% endhighlight %}
