Quick update... I've put together a long list of things I'd like to write about, so I should be updating regularly now.<p />Also, since I usually use Cubase, Waves plug-ins, and Reason in my howto articles, I created a wiki so people can share how they accomplish the same things in other programs (like ableton live, garageband, protools, etc). I will try to at least add the protools version to all of the more popular howtos myself, but I'll be relying on comunity support for pretty much all other software.<p />The wiki could also cover alternate plug-ins if a given tutorial (like <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/01/how-to-make-drums-go-pop.html">the one on drum comression</a>) pictures a specific plug-in.<p />The wiki is brand new and currently empty but feel free to add to it!<br />Death By Protools wiki: <a href="http://deathbyprotools.wetpaint.com/">http://deathbyprotools.wetpaint.com</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-6918673753519382816?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
