A <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/03/b-rig-guitar-technique-its-not-what-you.html">little while back</a> I mentioned that you should <span style="font-weight: bold;">always</span> use a DI box when recording electric guitar, but why? What does a DI box even do?<p />I'm so glad you asked! Without getting too technical:<br /><blockquote>A DI box is simply a device that makes an electrical copy of your signal while leaving the original alone. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_input">Click here for the nerdy nerdy</a>)<br />
</blockquote>Once you have this copy, you can record it directly and run the original to your amp.<p />Before I move on, I need to mention one more thing about DI's: They match impedance. You don't need to know what that means electrically, but here's what it means in practical terms; if you want to plug in anything with a 1/4" TS plug into your computer and record it (like a guitar/bass/keyboard/etc), you need to run it through a DI first.<br />[[posterous-content:fIacgxfhzJdjruguvoht]]<p />If you're not sure if you should use a DI or not... just use it. It usually won't mess anything up if you use one when you don't need to.<p />So why do we need to use a DI anyway? Well it's a little bit complicated but, in a nutshell, it gives you <span style="font-weight: bold;">near infinite flexibility</span> with your guitar tone. Here's how it works:<br /><ol>
<li>Plug your guitar <span style="font-weight: bold;">directly </span>into the DI box (before any pedals or anything)<br />
</li>
<li>Plug the balanced output (TRS or XLR) into one of the inputs on your audio interface</li>
<li>Plug the unbalanced output (TS aka another guitar cable) into your pedal board or amp.</li>
<li>Put a <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/03/b-rig-guitar-technique-its-not-what-you.html">microphone on the amp and make it sound good</a>.</li>
</ol><br />Here's how you'd connect the Preamp/DI I recommend in the <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/03/recording-yourself-on-budget.html">B-Rig gear list</a>:<br />[[posterous-content:wGykDjyahrxAzjklmszc]]<p />Now just record like normal, but make sure each take has 2 tracks recording. The DI on one track (should sound like clean guitar) and the microphone in front of the amp. You're gonna want to mute the DI track for now.<p />Once you've recorded <span style="font-weight: bold;">all the guitar parts</span> for this song/EP/Album, borrow a few great sounding amps from your friends (your friends all have beautiful gear... right?) and do a technique called <span style="font-style: italic;">reamping</span>.<br /><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Reamping is when you re-record the guitar parts through multiple amps in order to achieve a better guitar tone.<br />
</blockquote>You do it like so:<br /><ol>
<li>Set up a new, empty track for the reamped tracks<br />
</li>
<li>Put a microphone in front of the amp and set the new track to record mode<br />
</li>
<li>Hook up the output of your audio interface (aux send/direct out <span style="font-weight: bold;">or</span> you can use the Headphone output as a last resort) to the input of said guitar amp.</li>
<li>Solo the DI track</li>
<li>Hit play/record</li>
</ol>Of course you need to mess around and get a tone that compliments the orginal guitar tone that you already have.<p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> this trick is also great for removing metronome clicks, people talking, and other noise from your guitar tracks.<p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do not delete</span> your DI tracks once you've reamped the guitar. You may need them again - just keep them muted/disabled.<p />If anything is unclear (or you just want to let me know how much you like my blog) please leave a comment I'm always happy to help!<p />Happy reamping everyone!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-7214286709348625317?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
