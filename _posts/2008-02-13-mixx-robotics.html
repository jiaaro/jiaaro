I just think it's awsome! I will not, however, try to pretend I am not a <a href="http://www.mixx.com/users/justaboutrealjar">mixx user</a> - I am, and I love it. I'm really just <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/02/digg-users-revolt-ov.html">sick of digg.</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1087162989855557355-5930756880029242688?l=roborobert.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
