If you're talking to a musician and they mention the word hot, slap them in the face. Then proceed to politely ask for clarification.<p /><br />[[posterous-content:uFrjziAEihbddsGiyazb]]<p />There you have it. Hot as in <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/06/its-getting-hot-in-here-when-to-record.html">Loud</a>, Hot as in '<a href="http://www.askmen.com/women/galleries/celeb-profiles-actress/angelina-jolie/picture-1.html">hot</a> <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000I0KGV0.01-AEQUBR67DCF10._SCLZZZZZZZ_V60708388_.jpg">damn</a>', and Hot as in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts5Sxj-bPUc&amp;feature=related" title="eeePc? yeah I'm getting one... be jealous!">cool</a>.<p />Now I just need to think of an excuse for that google image search for '<acronym title="Yeah I know I spelled it wrong">sexy bakini</acronym>'. I really doubt my girlfriend is gonna buy the 'research for a blog post' one.<p />for real though, it wasn't cooperating with my more um... appropriate ones. Not to worry though, I used <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=searchguides.html&amp;ctx=preferences&amp;hl=en#safe">Moderate SafeSearch</a> ;)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-2943270579897391412?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
