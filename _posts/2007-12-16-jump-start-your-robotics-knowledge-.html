If you're interested in robotics, here's a great way to learn more!<p />whilst browsing the interblag, I stumbled upon a college with a degree in robotics and thought to myself, <blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">"hmm... why pay for it when you can look up their text books, and read an overview of each class!"<br />
</blockquote>It even tells you which courses provide the recommended background information!<p />The college is Worcester Polytechnic Institute (Massachusetts). I don't know much about them but if you're interested in getting a degree in robotics... maybe you should take a trip to MA and check them out.<p />Here's the page with their list of "Robotics Engineering" courses:<br /><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/Academics/Majors/RBE/courses.html">http://www.wpi.edu/Academics/Majors/RBE/courses.html</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1087162989855557355-6298684769378057317?l=roborobert.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
