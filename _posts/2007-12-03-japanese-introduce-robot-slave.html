<a href="http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/607637/23738064">Wased Group introduced the twendy-one</a>. A humanoid robot designed to integrate into daily life and help their human masters with whatever they desire. The Post is somewhat old, but the video's are still cool.<p />According to Waseda Group (the makers of the robot), robots must meet six requirements in order to be integrated into daily (human) life.<br /><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">... it must 1. be safe  2. create a sense of companionship 3. have means to communicate with humans 4. be skillful 5. be able to perform physical labor  6. have mobility</blockquote>I think the sense of companionship is desirable but not necessary. However... I can think of a few things I think a robot needs to integrate... like<br /><ul>
<li>To be small enough to travel where ever it's owner requires</li>
<li>To be able to fade into the surroundings so as to not be a hinderance. This includes being quiet, and intelligent about staying out of peoples way.</li>
<li>Using a portable source of power. A robot dragging around power/control cables wouldn't be very useful.<br />
</li>
