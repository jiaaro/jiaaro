I have become inspired by the recent adventures of a certain heroine, Elaine, Daughter of Mrs. Roberts (&lt;-- notice the 's', hence we are not related) If you are unfamiliar with this mysterious woman of the night, allow me to jog your memory:<p /> <a href="http://www.xkcd.com/343/">[[posterous-content:EyrJGkueolAdcupasAld]]<br />xkcd - 1337 part 3</a> see also: <a href="http://xkcd.com/341/">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://xkcd.com/342/">Part 2</a><p />I can not tell you what a great idea it is to become Elaine. I'll buy you flowers ;)<br />Also, you can join a sweet band like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/brokensocialscene">broken social scene</a><p />In other news, Last.fm is going to be doing <a href="http://puddlegum.net/lastfm-audio-fingerprinting-and-artist-tagging/">Audio fingerprinting</a> to identify songs more acurately. Should be good, but kind of scary on the copyright infringement side of things.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-4670732670431350061?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
