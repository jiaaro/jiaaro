Ok, <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2007/10/radiohead-vs-nineinchnails.html">I love Radiohead</a>. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+charts/?charttype=weekly&amp;subtype=track&amp;range=1191758400-1192363200">Last.fm loves Radiohead</a>. So everything is good right? Well, maybe not: Just because Radiohead can let their fans <a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/">pay whatever they want</a> doesn't mean it'll work for everyone else.<p />Radiohead's recent album, "In Rainbows," has enjoyed the limelight the past few weeks, especially on <a href="http://digg.com/search?s=radiohead&amp;submit=Search&amp;section=news&amp;type=both&amp;area=all&amp;sort=most">social media sites</a>. The success of the album has people talking about a possible new model for the music industry, and the <a href="http://www.purebuttons.com/pr/">amount of money some people have paid</a> for the album has been sort of a, "Told you so," directed at the RIAA and Label execs.<p />Before we all hop on the band wagon, we should take a few things into consideration:<br /><ol>
<li>Radiohead fans are notoriously loyal (madison square garden)<br />
</li>
<li>They've already had <a href="http://www.google.com/musica?aid=D5xA_vGw9NO&amp;num=10&amp;start=0">several</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead_discography#Albums">very successful</a> albums</li>
<li>They don't need the <a href="http://www.gigwise.com/news.asp?contentid=37720">money</a>
</li>
</ol>The problem: they're already so popular they can release a 10 track album, and secure all 10 of Last.fm's top 10 songs, the week the album is realeased:<br />[[posterous-content:uBqnIhefyIkakdryojho]]<br />Do you really think this is a good model for <span style="font-style: italic;">new</span> music? It seems to me, well established bands will be able to <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/1774958/posts">keep on making it</a>, while it will just get harder for lesser known artists to compete; especially as the expectation shifts toward cheaper/free distribution of music. Steve O'Hear did a nice writeup on <a href="http://www.last100.com/2007/10/11/music-industry-five-alternative-business-models/">alternative business models</a> suggesting that the music would be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader">loss leader</a> designed to get fans out to shows.<p />Seems hard:<br /><ol>
<li>Try to give away your music in an environment of nearly infinate competition (which will cost money)<br />
</li>
<li>Then try to get people to come to your shows (which will have to cost more to support the artists)</li>
</ol>What do <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> think? Leave a comment!<p />PS - If you like this blog please <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/DeathByProtools">subscribe</a>.
