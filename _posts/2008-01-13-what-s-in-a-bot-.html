title: What's in a bot?

I recently was having a discussion with someone and we both agreed that if something is driven around with a remote control, it isn't a robot. The consensus was that it has to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous">autonomous</a>, but after thing about the matter further, I'm not so sure.<p />Usually in this type of situation I consult <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot">Wikipedia</a>, like a good little nerd, however their entry isn't much help... it just confirms that this is an area of controversy.<p />Wikipedia lists the following as potential properties for defining a robot:<br /><ul>
<li>Is not 'natural' i.e. artificially created</li>
<li>Can sense its environment, and manipulate or interact with things in it</li>
<li>Has some degree of intelligence or ability to make choices based on the environment, often using automatic control or a preprogrammed sequence</li>
<li>Is programmable (see: <a href="http://arduino.cc/">arduino</a>)<br />
</li>
<li>Moves with one or more axes of rotation or translation</li>
<li>Makes dexterous coordinated movements</li>
<li>Appears to have intent or agency (See anthropomorphism for examples of ascribing intent to inanimate objects.)</li>
</ul>However, you can make strong arguments against several of these points... so I wonder: How do <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> define a robot?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1087162989855557355-4139271602423382196?l=roborobert.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
