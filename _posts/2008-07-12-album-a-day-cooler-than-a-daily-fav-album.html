My buddy <a href="http://timfitzpatrick.wordpress.com/">Tim</a> brought the concept of <a href="http://crapart.spacebar.org/">Crap Art</a>, and more specifically, the <a href="http://crapart.spacebar.org/aad/">Album-a-day</a>, to my attention. Man was I missing out...<p />I have to say, this is something everyone should do at least once - like driving until you run out of gas, or staying up all night to watch the sunrise.<p />[[posterous-content:AJtqsodwvuokErEuadwC]]<p />Album-a-day is not a site where a favorite album is highlighted each day. No... it's something far more interesting than that. Album-a-day is when people write, and record an entire album in 24 hours. It's an exercise in creativity.<p />Here are the rules, right off the <a href="http://crapart.spacebar.org/aad/">main site</a>:<br /><ol>
<li>It must be written, performed, recorded, post-produced, etc. all in one contiguous 24-hour period (preferably with no sleep break in there).</li>
<li>It must be at least 20 minutes or 30 songs. (many short songs tend to work better than long songs which drag on forever, trust me.)  </li>
<li>Your band may have multiple participants, but they should not work on different songs simultaneously. (So just one song being worked on at a time.)  </li>
<li>No ideas from before the chosen day! This means covers or reinterpretations are not allowed.  </li>
<li>No out-takes! If you start a song, finish it and put it on the album.  </li>
</ol><br />I have a few qualms with the rules (who really wants to listen to 30 songs that are less than 45 seconds each?) , but it's still an awesome idea, and totally worth doing.<p />[[posterous-content:urGDpyxkGdixoEshBBCk]]<p />Plus, you can video tape the whole thing and add it to your parents' home video collection as a kind of cute prank. I know... I'm a little weird.<p />A few tips to make it go smoothly:<br /><ol>
<li>Set up all your gear, and <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/03/recording-yourself-on-budget.html">recording stuff</a> the night before, so you can focus on writing during your precious 24 hours</li>
<li>Get a friend to stop by a few times throughout the day with a video camera, and (regular) camera to help you document how awesome those 24 hours were. It <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a home video right?<br />
</li>
<li>Don't be too much of a perfectionist or you won't finish<br />
</li>
<li>Try new things, make it <a href="http://deathbyprotools.com/2008/06/makes-music-interesting.html">interesting</a><br />
</li>
<li>Have fun!<br />
</li>
</ol><br />Ok, I know the 'have fun' part was a little campy, but it felt right.<p />So, do an album-a-day, let me know about it, and I'll totally drop you a link :) It's a good way to get some <a href="http://www.mixtake.com/PackMyspace.aspx">tracks up on the myspace</a> too.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-2847135626707630605?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
