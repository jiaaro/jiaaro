hello all,<p />I havn't posted in a while but I <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> written a little program to help with ripping DVDs. It's for use with <a href="http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/">DVD::Rip by Joern Reder</a>. And it queues up the projects so you can leave your computer running over night.<p />The program is written in python and pretty thoroughly commented (though all in one file). I hope someone finds this useful. Note: I applied for a SourceForge project space, bur for now, here is the code:<p /><a href="http://mixtake.com/roborobert/dvdrip-queue/dvdrip-queue-0.1b.tar.gz">dvdrip-queue-0.1b.tar.gz</a><br />MD5: 0ab561032354c2e2261838524637d65f<p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">update</span>: The project is now on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvdrip-queue/">sourceForge</a>. Please <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=231138">submit bugs</a> as you find them<p />The program is licensed under the GPLv3 so I encourage you to do what you like with it. And Please feel free to comment if you have any problems, I'll respond quick, promise :)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1087162989855557355-8951700212574850629?l=roborobert.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
