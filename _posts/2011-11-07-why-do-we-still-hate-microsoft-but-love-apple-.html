title: Why do we still hate Microsoft but love Apple?
published: true

<p>Apple has grown larger than Microsoft. This is old news. Steve Jobs (RIP) never became a philanthropist like Bill Gates. So why do the technorati hold Jobs in such high regard will still harboring resentment for Gates?</p>
<p>I think the differentiation is in the context under which we use their products.</p>
<p>I find myself with other options in every arena in which I use Apple's products. I <strong>choose</strong> to use them because I want to.</p>
<p>Let's compare this with Microsoft. I often find myself using Microsoft products because I have no other choices.</p>
<p>I use Excel because Google docs wasn't able to open a complex spreadsheet created with Excel.</p>
<p>I use Word because Open Office couldn't display the track changes recorded in Word.</p>
<p>I use Windows to test my websites in Internet Explorer because IE isn't available anywhere else.</p>
<p>The one <strong>notable exception</strong> is Xbox; I love my Xbox. I chose it over playstation.</p>
<p>I wasn't strong-armed into using Xbox through anti-competitive practices, it's a good product that I <em>wanted</em> to use.</p>
<p>I don't think profit, or good vs. evil has anything to do with it. We simply like companies when we&nbsp;<strong>choose</strong> to use their products -- over and over -- because they're better.</p>
