<p>Let's start with first principles. I want to know things; I want to know almost everything I can. In all but a select few scenarios I'll put in the time to learn something vs not.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how this all got started, but it feels like nobody wants to explain anything anymore. I see it among friends, strangers, between parents and their children, all over.</p>
<p>Let's take a ride in the <a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php" title="I'm a robot">wayback machine</a>.... *whirrrrrrr*</p>
<p>Way back in the day, when I was a wee little high school student, I played the guitar. We all did. If you want to get laid in high school, you join the football team or you play guitar. I played guitar.</p>
<p>There's actually one more step: you have to play for somebody.</p>
<p>So there I was.</p>
<p>Some kind soul had agreed to let us, a rowdy group of suburban teens, make loud, awesome noise for a few hours. And the guitar slingers among us were getting ready to melt faces.</p>
<p>I doubt this particular individual understood the complex set of motives for our playing guitars (scene cred, getting laid, or both), but that's a story for another time.</p>
<p>One particular guy, let's call him Jake, was sitting alone with his guitar doing something I'd never seen before, tuning with harmonics. It's really nothing special, but I was young and stupid and my motives were more than a little misplaced.</p>
<p>Even despite that, I like to know things. I asked about it.</p>
<p>"It's just a dumb trick," Jake tells me.</p>
<p>We went back and forth for a while, him telling me it's nothing and trying to get me to leave, and my pressing for more information.</p>
<p>I eventually got him to tell me it was the 5th and 7th fret harmonics, and you can use them to tune a guitar (in so many words). At the risk of being a huge hypocrite, I'm going to skip over that for now as it's not relevant to my story, but you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSth9bmDFGg" title="Learn to tune a guitar using harmonics">learn how on youtube</a>.</p>
<p>That isn't a particularly uncommon <span>occurence</span>. Some people just don't want to explain anything.</p>
<p>I have a couple ideas why.</p>
<p>Maybe Jake is impatient and he doesn't want to waste his time teaching whenever he knows anything.</p>
<p>Maybe he's shy, and embarrassed by suddenly becoming the authority on this one infinitesimally small topic.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, he'd have saved us both some time by just spitting out the one sentence explanation. If it's the former he's doing a disservice to the world, and in the case of the latter, to himself.</p>
<p>Google is great, but half the battle is knowing what to search for in the first place. It's usually the hardest step and presents a pretty big barrier to entry when you're first learning about anything.</p>
<p>Until google can read minds, we still need other people to help us along the way. So don't dumb it down for me. Give it to me straight.</p>
