title: SSL Certificates are Miserable
published: true
---
<p>So... I was tasked with setting up https for a website recently. I was setting up Nginx with an ssl certificate from thawte. </p>
<p>Pretty normal. Pretty standard. Pretty aweful.<p />Here's to helping the next guy get through the process quicker than I did.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Before you start. <strong>Don't use a browser or openssl</strong> to test your config. It will waste your time and make you unhappy. </p>

<p>Use this tool to test your ssl config:</p> 

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.digicert.com/help/">http://www.digicert.com/help/</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Certificate Signing Requests (*.csr), PEM Files, Intermediary Certificates, root CACertificate, Secondary Certificate BS, and more</h2>

<p>You should know Apache and several other web servers expect your ssl certificate to be in a separate file from the intermediary certificates Like this <a href="http://www.apache-ssl.org/httpd.conf.example">example http.conf</a></p>

{% highlight bash %}
# your key file (often called www.example.com.key or privatekey.pem)
SSLCertificateKeyFile /www/certs/ssl.fictional.co.key

# your ssl certificate (often called www.example.com.crt or certificate.pem)
SSLCertificateFile /www/certs/ssl.fictional.co.cert

#intermediary certificates (often a *.crt or *.pem file)
SSLCACertificateFile /www/certs/CA.cert
{% endhighlight %}

<p>ok great... but some other web servers expect <strong>your intermediary certificates to be concatenated with your ssl certificate</strong> (i.e. the one you paid for). So open up notepad and copy/paste that CA.cert into the end of your ssl.fictional.co.cert and hit save.</p>

<h2>What about Nginx?</h2>
<p>now your nginx config for ssl (<a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSslModule">documentation here</a>) will look like this:</p>
{% highlight nginx %}
http {
  server {
    listen 443;
    ssl on;

    # this file contains the ssl.fictional.co.cert AND CA.cert from
    # the apache example
    ssl_certificate /usr/local/nginx/conf/cert.pem;

    # this file corresponds to the ssl.fictional.co.key from the apache example
    ssl_certificate_key /usr/local/nginx/conf/cert.key;

  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Conclusion. SSLâ€¦<br /> is a pain in the ass.</p>
