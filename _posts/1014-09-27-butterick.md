What do you get in exchange for writing a book? Well one in ~650 people will give you $10. But there's an unquantifiable part. Trust.

That's why people bought Butterick's fonts. And it's why he should have an RSS feed, and collect email addresses. Those people who read the whole book but don't send any money (or buy any fonts). Those people now trust him. Maybe they'll buy the book for a friend (if that was possible). Maybe they'll buy his next book. Maybe when he creates a new font, with special care for code they'll buy that. If they knew about it.
