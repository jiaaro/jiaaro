title: Mono to Stereo... the quest of champions!
published: true

This post will be short... it's just a little tutorial on how to make a track you recorded in mono (with 1 microphone) <span style="font-weight: bold;">sound like stereo</span>.<p />This is great for lots of things, especially those backgroundy tracks... you know...<br /><ul>
<li>Guitars</li>
<li>Drum Overhead mics</li>
<li>Backup vocals</li>
<li>Piano</li>
</ul>Sometimes it's even better than <span style="font-style: italic;">actually </span>recording it in stereo! Like with acoustic guitar.<p />Since the best sound comes from near the sound hole, there isn't a lot of space to put the mics. And even when you do get two mics in there, they generally sound the same... making it really hard to get a good stereo sound! Welcome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_effect">Haas effect</a>!<p />The Haas effect is the official name of the trick I'm about to explain... whatever. If you're feeling nerdy, just hit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_effect">wikipedia link</a> (while you're at it why don't you <a href="http://roborobert.com/">build a robot</a> and <a href="http://www.tvwithoutpictures.com/">start a podcast</a> too?)<p />There are a few times you should not do this trick:<br /><ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Main melodic track</span> - needs to be mono, and panned close to center<br />
</li>
<ul>
<li>Lead vocals</li>
<li>Lead guitar</li>
<li>Lead anything really</li>
</ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anything with a lot of bass</span>... (Haas effect doesn't play nice with low frequencies)</li>
<ul>
<li>Bass guitar</li>
<li>Upright Bass</li>
<li>Bass Drum</li>
<li>Bass anything really<br />
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Snare drum</span> - I guess it's too important to be stereo, who knows?<br />
</li>
</ul>Hooray for seemingly arbitrary rules! Woo hoo! Exclamation point! Lets get down to business! ok I'm done...<p />Here's how to do it in <span style="font-weight: bold;">3 easy steps</span>:<br /><ol>
<li>You make a copy of you mono track (so now you have 2 of the same thing).</li>
<li>You pan one track all the way left, and the other all the way right. Now you have <span style="font-weight: bold;">the same mono signal... just louder</span> (since it's the same signal coming out of both speakers)</li>
<li>Put a delay on one of the tracks, with a delay time somewhere in the range of 10ms - 25ms.</li>
</ol>I know cubase can add this delay without any plug-ins which is nice (I'll post a picture tomorrow). In protools/others you can use a "slap-back" delay, or other short delay... just make sure there's no feedback, modulation, eq, etc.<p /><a href="http://www.myspace.com/ourtwilightpastime">Happy</a> <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=319526626">stereoizing</a> <a href="http://mikescomic.wordpress.com/">mike</a>!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8547568058334781866-6747807951190645490?l=deathbyprotools.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
